# Dungeons-n-Dragons-game
The game covers up the various design pattern in order to implement the game architecture.

*********************************
The given code provides examples of character classes (e.g., Ranger). Innate abilities are numerous, but we will consider the following ones:
•	Strength: burly, fit, scrawny, plump
•	Dexterity: slim, sneaky, awkward, clumsy
•	Constitution: strong, healthy, frail, sick
•	Intelligence: inquisitive, studious, simple, forgetful
•	Wisdom: good judgement, empathy, foolish, oblivious
•	Charisma: leadership, confidence, timid, awkward
Redesign the given code to allow adding abilities to the characters so that new “values” for innate abilities could be added later without having to modify (much) the implementation of the character classes (e.g., a new Constitution: invincible).
